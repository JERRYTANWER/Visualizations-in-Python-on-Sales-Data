# Visualizations-in-Python-on-Sales-Data

**Sales Data Visualization in Python**
This repository contains Python code for visualizing sales data of a leading pharmaceutical company using various charts and graphs. The objective of this project is to provide a dynamic dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) at different levels (National, Region & Territory) to help understand sales trends, patterns, and factors influencing customer behavior.

**Case Study Overview**
Data Visualization Importance:
Data visualization is crucial as it helps in understanding complex data by placing it in a visual context. It enables decision-makers to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that might go unnoticed in text-based data. Visualizations facilitate quicker comprehension and decision-making by presenting analytics visually.

**Objectives**:
The objectives of this dashboard are to:
1. Compare sales by region for 2016 with 2015 using a bar chart.
2. Analyze the contributing factors to sales for each region in 2016 using a pie chart.
3. Compare total sales of 2015 and 2016 by Region and Tiers.
4. Identify states in the East region that registered a decline in 2016 compared to 2015.
5. Determine divisions in the High tier that saw a decline in the number of units sold in 2016 compared to 2015.
6. Create a new column 'Qtr' based on months for quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
7. Compare quarter-wise sales in 2015 and 2016 using a bar plot.
8. Determine the composition of quarter-wise sales in 2016 with regards to all Tiers using pie charts.
